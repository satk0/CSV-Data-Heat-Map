You can easily navigate through the program and use zoom to focus on more important parts of data, while 
having a chance to choose aggregation methods, namely: `Sum, Mean, Min, Max`.

Analyzing the data, we could see that the peak of the COVID cases was in January 2022, while the most affected countries were Denmark, Czechia, Germany and Europe as a whole. 
This visualisation could be broken, but it is just "Proof Of Concept".

Of course, this app is just in completely beta-state. Honestly, it is not even beta. So be aware of a lot of bugs and untrustworthy functionality of the app.
