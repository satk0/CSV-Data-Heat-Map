### Covid-19 New Cases CSV Heat Map:

![Covid-19 New Cases CSV Heat Map](/screenshots/new_covid_cases.png?raw=true "Covid-19 New Cases Data (from 2020 to 2022)")

Analyzing the data, we could see that the peak of the cases was in January 2022, while the most affected countries were Denmark, Czechia, Germany and Europe as a whole. 
This visualisation could be broken, but it is just "Proof Of Concept".

Of course, this app is just in completely beta-state. Honestly, it is not even beta. So be aware of a lot of bugs and untrustworthy functionality of the app.
